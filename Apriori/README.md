Wish I can succeed.

I decide to use the AVL tree written by me a long time ago.The AVL tree is not good enough now.I decide to rewrite it.

I find out that the AVL tree that I put on the github is not the latest version of my AVl tree.I push the latest version of AVL tree and read it now.I surprise to find that the latest version of it is written in c not cpp.I think I will rewrite it in cpp.QAQ
